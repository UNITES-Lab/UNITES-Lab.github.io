                            <li>We always have openings for truly outstanding PhD students, starting at every year's spring and fall semesters (so no need to inquiry "whether you have PhD openings" by email). Our group is well funded, and research assistantships will be provided to PhD students by default.</li>
                            <li>Interested candidates for PhD opportunities are strongly encouraged to contact Dr. Wang by <a href="mailto:atlaswang@utexas.edu">email</a>. Please attach your CV, and clearly discuss your research interest and experiences. We are usually not very interested in your GPA and standard test scores.</li>
                            <li>Postdocs, and self-funded visitors are welcome to apply, and will be evaluated case by case. Due to the recent challenging situation of international travels, we are also open to remote collaborations, on certain basic research topics of common interest.</li>
                            <li>We are always open to working with UT undergraduates and master students for research projects. Please contact Dr. Wang by <a href="mailto:atlaswang@utexas.edu">email</a> and specify your interest.</li>

                            <li>Nothing is more important than a true enthusiasm and devotion to research. We do research only because we are really obsessed with and enjoy our research. Our research interests constantly evolve, and we always stay open to be intellectually excited and inspired by new things.</li>
                            <li>Two other important things that we look for: (1) a truly deep understanding of your problem of interest - don’t naively plug and play "hot" tools; (2) a solid background and a true passion for mathematics. Our research heavily leverages matrix analysis, optimization, and statistical learning.</li>

                            <li>We have a very flat management structure with minimal communication overhead (“Talk is cheap. Show me the code/math”). Every student works directly and closely with Dr. Wang. The group also benefits a lot from its highly interactive, intimate, and helpful culture.</li>
                            <li>We provide extraordinarily strong support to students for internship, visiting, collaboration, and networking opportunities. You can check from current group members' rich experiences. </li>
                            <li>Our students are highly sought after by top employers, for both internship and full-time opportunities. Taking summer 2021 for one example, VITA students secure research internship offers from Google Brain (2), Facebook Research (2), Microsoft Research (2), Amazon (2), Adobe Research, ByteDance, etc. </li>

He was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, at the Texas A&M University, from 2017 to 2020. He received his Ph.D. degree in ECE from UIUC in 2016, advised by Professor Thomas S. Huang; and his B.E. degree in EEIS from USTC in 2012. Prof. Wang is broadly interested in the fields of machine learning, computer vision, optimization, and their interdisciplinary applications. His latest interests focus on automated machine learning (AutoML), learning-based optimization, machine learning robustness, and efficient deep learning. His research is gratefully supported by NSF, DARPA, ARL/ARO, as well as a few more industry and university grants. He is an elected technical committee member of IEEE MLSP; an associate editor of IEEE TCSVT (in which capacity he received the 2020 IEEE TCSVT Best Associate Editor Award); and frequently serves as area chairs, guest editors, invited speakers, various panelist positions and reviewers. He has received many research awards and scholarships, including most recently an ARO Young Investigator award, an IBM Faculty Research Award, an Amazon Research Award (AWS AI), an Adobe Data Science Research Award, a Young Faculty Fellow of TAMU, and four research competition prizes from CVPR/ICCV/ECCV. </p>
